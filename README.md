2. Pixel based image analysis of the continuum spectrum
3. Ridgeline fitting

There are a couple of python packages required for the software package:

* astropy
* scipy
* numpy
* scikit-image
* ehtim

Furthermore it is recommended to install the following astronomical packages for more advanced routines:

* CASA
* difmap
