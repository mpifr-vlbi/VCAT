Oveview of all ToDo Items and the responsible persons.
 
- Jet Pixel Analysys [Luca, Vieri, Jan, Petra, Jack]
 - Script takes already aligned and convolved images and does the synchrotron fitting pixel by pixel DONE
  - turn-over frequency, turn-over flux, Chi2 etc ... and produces plots of this
 - Pixel-by-Pixel analysis of jet (Luca) DONE
 - Synchrotron turnover fitting, B-field estimate (Luca) DONE
 - Currently the script needs the jet to go along the y-axis, he wants to change it (Luca)
  - Still working on this, but the script will have a rotation implemented, piping to CASA in the background to rotate the map. 

- Ridge-line Fitting [Luca, Vieri]
 - Finalizing updates (Luca)
 - Double-ridge line extension (Vieri, Luca)

- Aligning images [Anne, Jan]
 - On model components (Felix)
  - propagation errors properly, calculate magentic field strengths etc, spectral fit
- using 2D cross-correlation with mask in Fourier space [Anne] DONE
  - implementing new masks (Jan)
  - Spectral Index maps [Anne] DONE
  - add enclosing ellipe to restore images (Anne)
  - combine VMAP ? (Anne,Jan, Petra, ChatGPT)
  - make it interactive, especially for the masking, can reuse some info from VMAP (Jan, Anne, Florian)
 - Align script changes by Anne, Felix, and Jan (Anne, Felix, Jan)
  - Get an idea of the uncertainty of the shift and its impact on the spectral index map (Felix)
  - Use other masks (Jan)
  - use VMAP cross-correlation plots to show these plots for the alignment (Anne)

- Modelfit analysis (Anne)
 - Felix will test it (Felix)
 
- Write everything up into a publication, should we have a deadline? Spring 2024 [Jan, Anne, Luca]

- Github Documentation wiki/webpage [Anne]
 - Combine documentation of everything (Anne)
 - will send a mail with a reference script

- Make another code to specifically re-gridded the image (same pixel-size, beam, and center on the peak),also do rotation (Anne,Luca)
  Maybe add to CleanMap class

- Have meetings every two weeks, Anne creates a when2meet (Anne)
