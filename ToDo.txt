Oveview of all ToDo Items and the responsible persons.

- Have a summary file on the work progess, google-sheet, look into optionw within github 
 - set up google sheet (Luca)

- For every script provide a short example. Every analysis should work stand-alone and there should be a guide on how to combine everything.
 
- Jet Pixel Analysys [Luca, Vieri, Jan, Petra, Jack] DONE
 - Script takes already aligned and convolved images and does the synchrotron fitting pixel by pixel DONE
  - turn-over frequency, turn-over flux, Chi2 etc ... and produces plots of this
 - Pixel-by-Pixel analysis of jet (Luca) DONE
 - Synchrotron turnover fitting, B-field estimate (Luca) DONE
 - Currently the script needs the jet to go along the y-axis, he wants to change it (Luca)
  - Still working on this, but the script will have a rotation implemented, piping to CASA in the background to rotate the map. 

- Ridge-line Fitting [Luca, Vieri]
 - Double-ridge line extension (Vieri, Luca)
 - Working on it (Luca), double-sided jets sometimes do make problems
 - Jan talked with Alexei about best way to write the best ridge-line

- Aligning images [Anne, Jan, Felix]
 - Have an extra meeting/mail exchange to bring the different versions together [Anne]
 - On model components (Felix)
  - propagation errors properly, calculate magentic field strengths etc, spectral fit
- using 2D cross-correlation with mask in Fourier space [Anne] DONE
  - implementing new masks (Jan)
  - Spectral Index maps [Anne] DONE
  - add enclosing ellipe to restore images (Anne)
  - combine VMAP ? (Anne,Jan, Petra, ChatGPT)
  - make it interactive, especially for the masking, can reuse some info from VMAP (Jan, Anne, Florian)
 - Align script changes by Anne, Felix, and Jan (Anne, Felix, Jan)
  - Get an idea of the uncertainty of the shift and its impact on the spectral index map (Felix)
  - Use other masks (Jan)
  - use VMAP cross-correlation plots to show these plots for the alignment (Anne)

- Modelfit analysis (Anne)
 - Felix will test if it works (Felix)
 
- Write everything up into a publication, should we have a deadline? Spring 2024 [Jan, Anne, Luca]

- Github Documentation wiki/webpage [Anne]
 - Combine documentation of everything (Anne)
 - will send a mail with a reference script

- Make another code to specifically re-gridded the image (same pixel-size, beam, and center on the peak). Have two scripts:
 - Using difmap [Florian]
 - Using ehtim [Anne]

- Also do rotation (Anne,Luca). Maybe add to CleanMap class

- Common ellipse for image restoring (Florian)

- Polarization plotting [Florian] Done

- RM Maps add at a later point [Felix]

- Have meetings every two weeks (Anne)
