VCAT meeting 12.02.2024.

- Anne shows github to-do list
- Luca: Working on ridgeline script. Often one dimensional Gauss for ridgeline works
 better for clearly edge brightened jet, work on that. So far, worked with chisq
 criterion to decide if one or two Gaussians are best.
 Ridgeline fir for two-sides jets sometimes has unknown problems.
- Anne (from last minutes): option 1: derive ridgeline from slices, option 2:
 use polar coordinates. Latter should be better for curved jet.
- Luca: Up to now, follow evolution of brightest pixel along jet and adjust the
 perpendicular.
- Felix: way to go polar then?
- Luca: old code by Nick MacDonald that does that not working well.
- Anne: use code by Jun Liu? 'headache' uses polar coords. Worth looking into?
 Aleksei find maximum of jet slice by doing circles. Luca could talk to Jan and Alexei
 for that.
- Anne: links to headache git: https://github.com/junliu/headache
- Luca: wants precise list of things already done and think about structure of final
 VCAT package. Suggests google sheet to track progress.
 Link here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10T53wqHsvBxpH8uEKn1AwZu_dLI-9nOOFI3rDqgabQc/edit#gid=0
- Felix: says github tracks code history and has function to add comments to commits.
 Good to have sheet with overall progress still. Should be enough and any project
 planning software is likely overkill.
Anne, Jan and Felix will schedule extra meeting to discuss alignment script, as
 everyone has been working on improvements on different parts that need to be aligned.
- Felix will test modelfit plotting script by Anne.
- Luca: ridgeline fit script should work independently. Original script was too large
 right now.
- Felix: could have ridge line fit return values/file/object to pass to other scripts.
- Anne: align way to comment code. Will test automated scripts to comment code.
- Florian: has script using difmap to restore maps with common beam. Could also do pixel
 size. What approach to use for common beams in aligning maps? difmap, ehtim (latter used
 in Anne's alignment script, just Gaussian blur)?
- Luca: for VLA maps, quite different results with both kinds of approaches.
- Florian will provide script. Also has script to mathematically determine best common beam.
- Anne: Please upload as work alone script.
- FLorian: shows pol.-map plot script (also modelfit plot, CC plot). Should be useful in
 the future.

Next meeting scheduled for 26.02.
